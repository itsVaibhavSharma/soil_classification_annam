# Soil Type Classification - Deep Learning Project

This repository contains the implementation for soil type classification using deep learning (ResNet50). The model classifies soil images into four categories: Alluvial soil, Black Soil, Clay soil, and Red soil.

## Notebooks

###  `training.ipynb`
- Located at `challenge-1/notebooks/training.ipynb`
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset
- Computes dataset statistics and class weights
- Applies augmentations and transformations
- Trains a **ResNet50** model using PyTorch
- Tracks and logs metrics (accuracy, F1 macro/min)
- Saves the best model to `best_resnet50.pth`

###  `inference.ipynb`
- Loads the trained model
- Applies test-time preprocessing
- Generates predictions on test images
- Saves predictions to `submission.csv` in competition format

---

##  Key Modules

### `src/preprocessing.py`
- `SoilDataset`: PyTorch-compatible dataset loader
- `compute_dataset_stats`: Calculates mean and std for normalization
- `get_transforms`: Defines augmentation and normalization pipelines

### `src/postprocessing.py`
- `predict`: Runs inference on the test/validation set
- `evaluate`: Computes F1 scores, confusion matrix, classification report
- `create_submission`: Generates submission CSV from predictions

---

##  Model Info

- Model: `ResNet50` (pretrained backbone)
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Loss: `CrossEntropyLoss` with class weights
- Augmentations: Flip, Rotation, Affine transform
- Metric: **Minimum F1-score across all classes**

---

##  Final Performance

From `ml-metrics.json` (see `docs/cards/`):

| Soil Type       | F1 Score |
|------------------|----------|
| Alluvial soil    | 0.98     |
| Black Soil       | 0.98     |
| Clay soil        | 0.98     |
| Red soil         | 0.99     |

---

##  Dataset Format

The dataset should be placed as:

```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”œâ”€â”€ train_labels.csv
â””â”€â”€ test_ids.csv
```

Each row in `train_labels.csv` must contain:
- `image_id`
- `soil_type`

Each row in `test_ids.csv` must contain:
- `image_id`

---

##  Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using GPU with CUDA:

```bash
# Example for CUDA 11.8
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

---

##  Submission Format

Output CSV (`submission.csv`) must have:

```csv
image_id,soil_type
img_123.jpg,Red soil
img_456.jpg,Alluvial soil
...
```

##  How to Run `training.ipynb`

### ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Run via Jupyter Notebook Interface (Recommended)

1. **Activate your environment** (if using `venv` or `conda`):
   ```bash
   conda activate your_env_name
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Navigate to**:
   ```
   challenge-1/notebooks/training.ipynb
   ```

4. **Open the notebook** and run each cell sequentially:
   - It will train the ResNet50 model.
   - Logs validation accuracy, F1-scores (macro, min).
   - Saves the best model as `best_resnet50.pth` in the current directory.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Run via Command Line (Non-interactive)

You can run the notebook headlessly and export output as HTML:

```bash
cd challenge-1/notebooks
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute training.ipynb --output training_output.ipynb
```

> This will create a new file `training_output.ipynb` with outputs embedded.

---

###  Output Files

- `best_resnet50.pth`: Saved PyTorch model (after training)
- `training_output.ipynb`: (Optional) Notebook with outputs (if using CLI)
